Pywal-discord is a tool that makes and applies theme to discord with colors generated by <a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal" target="_blank">pywal</a>

This is a fork that just essentually changes pywal-discord so it can work on MacOS, if I have the time, I will make it so it works on both linux and mac so we can merge it
to the original branch, (most of the patch is just changing paths).

#### Requires:

- any css loader for discord (default configuration for BetterDiscord)
- pywal (`pip install --user pywal`)

#### Works on:

- MacOS (rn the only platform tested on)

#### Installation:

```
cd python-pywal
./install
```
